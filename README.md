## Assignment 1 - The Sensor Symphony üéº

### Overview:
Our first assignment was all about getting up close and personal with sensors. We explored the nuts and bolts of sensor networks, dabbled in communication protocols, and tested the capabilities of various sensors. Think of it as orchestrating a symphony where each sensor plays a crucial note.

### Libraries Used:
- `numpy` (for crunching numbers with ease)
- `matplotlib` (because visualizing data is key)
- `pandas` (to handle data like a pro)
- `scipy` (bringing the power of science to our analysis)
- `networkx` (for some network magic)

### Steps to Run Assignment:

1. **Extract the Content:**
   Unzip `Assignment_1_Sensing.zip` in your local system. It‚Äôs like unboxing a toolkit‚Äîfull of essentials for your wireless journey.

2. **Open the Notebook:**
   Launch the `Assignment_1_Sensing.ipynb` file in your preferred environment‚ÄîJupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or VS Code. Make sure to update the paths if needed.

3. **Follow the Procedure:**
   Run the notebook step by step, following the workflow laid out in the file. It's like following a recipe‚Äîeach step brings you closer to the final dish.

### Highlights:

1. **Sensor Network Setup:**
   - Configured and deployed a wireless sensor network. It‚Äôs like setting up a team, where each sensor has a role to play.

2. **Data Collection and Analysis:**
   - Collected data from various sensors and analyzed it. Imagine being a detective, gathering clues and piecing together the big picture.

3. **Communication Protocol Testing:**
   - Tested different communication protocols to see which one works best under various conditions. It‚Äôs like choosing the right language to get your message across.
